Here's a quick afternoon sketch project I worked on to test out a 2D platform game engine I've been developing. I scanned in a rough drawing from my sketchpad, and digitally painted it with a watercolour style in PhotoShop.

I'm creating dozens of these floating islands to use as exploratory environments in the game levels. In PhotoShop I created a bunch of simple custom pencil and paint brushes to add to the hand-drawn and painted look.
